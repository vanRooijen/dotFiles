# Raymond's Dotfiles
Look at the following example for a good README.md
I should definitely use the way of formatting those pictures. It looks really good.

Example:

|nvim_example|terminal|music_player|
|--|--|--|
|![img](previews/nvim_example.png)|![img](previews/terminal_example.png)|![img](previews/music_player_example_01.png)|

***Please note I am not doing the below yet, I am still creating the dotfiles. It is a work in progress.***

## Quick Installation Instructions
I have put a README.md in each of the directories. 
The README.md contains:
- An important explanation of where the specific configuration file should be 
located on your system
- A brief explanation of what the directory contains.
- A Screenshot of how the finished config looks

Possibly provide some pointers...
