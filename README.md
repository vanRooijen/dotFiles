# Raymond's Dot Files

***Please note I am not doing the below yet, I am still creating the dotfiles. It is a work in progress.***

TODO: 

I want to include the following type table in my README.md to create a good overall of everything.
Example:

|[nvim_example](other/nvim_setup)|[terminal](terminal_setup)|[music_player](other/music_player)|
|--|--|--|
|![img](previews/nvim_example.png)|![img](previews/terminal_example.png)|![img](previews/music_player_example_01.png)|
