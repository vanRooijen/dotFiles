# This start of this script is wrong, but still something I will have to build
# into the script, I initially just wanted a script to seperate the installation
# of Variety, however I have now decided as I know to seperate much more than
# that. This is now the wallpaper installation script.

echo "Variety is a wallpaper manager for Linux systems. It supports out-of-the-box
most Linux desktop environments, and can be configured to work on more esoteric ones.
It can use local images or automatically download wallpapers from Flickr, Wallhaven,
Unsplash, Bing, Reddit and other online sources.

How I use variety?
I set it to fetch wallpapers locally from whatever directory is my favorite at
the time.
Further I have a keybinding setup to pull up a banner of all the wallpapers in that directory,
that allows me to choose one without any hassle.
I do this by creating a key binding to run the following command in bash.
'variety --selector'"
