# Expansion Idea

I really think a great idea would be to create a sort of a cloud for your
entire gnome system. This could be somewhat separate from the dotfiles, but only
the very specific ones, not the gnome specific ones. GTK is debatable, however I
think I might include it.

Generally just a place you can store things like all your gnome settings, and
even your things like your extensions and your themes.

With the cloud being used, could maybe be github, seeing as it is free.
Or any other cloud service you might be willing to pay for.

Maybe for a more mainstream audience, I could also create optional backups of
other important files.

Further then expanding on this idea, maybe you could just back everything up to
an external hard drive.

A nice idea to play with.

## Conclusions
Talking about this, has me thinking it would actually be a great idea, however
thus, I should focus less on the actual installation script and it should be
purely that an installation script...

Thinking however of the installation of application with different sources, I
think that is still a good idea, you should be able to backup your gnome
environment no matter what OS you are using, so things like the distribution
check will still be necessary, however for now, I don't think I should focus on
it. If they want to install something they can do it themselves.
